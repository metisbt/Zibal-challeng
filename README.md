# Zibal-challeng
## The Zibal Challenge was designed and implemented with the aim of inquiry, verification, and conversion through APIs. This is achieved by establishing connections to the main server and relevant sections using APIs. It involves querying the IBAN number and identity information to convert the card number into an account number, and even verifying identity and banking information, among other functionalities. For the web-based platform, HTML and CSS were used for the front end, while Python and the Flask framework were employed for the back end.
